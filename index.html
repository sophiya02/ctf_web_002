      Thor, the powerful god of thunder in Norse mythology, was the mighty defender of gods and goddesses, who were constantly under siege by the forces of chaos. Thor was the most popular god in the Norse pantheon, and his many exploits are recalled in many myths and tales—far more than any other Norse god or goddess. Honorable, loyal, and brave, Thor best represented the values of the warrior class of ancient Germany and Scandinavia.
      
      Thor was the oldest and most powerful son of Odin, the ruler of the Norse gods called Aesir. Thor defended their home, called Asgard, from the forces of chaos, represented by the Jotun, a race of giants who were ancient enemies of the Aesir. Thor’s main weapon was his hammer, called Mjollnir (also spelled Mjolnir), which was so heavy that only Thor could lift it. Mjollnir could smash whole mountains and it never missed its mark when thrown. Lightning flashed whenever Thor threw Mjollnir, and thunder rumbled as Thor’s chariot crossed the sky.</p>
